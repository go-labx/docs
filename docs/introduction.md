## Minimalist design principles

The `Lightning` framework is designed with minimalist principles in mind. It is built to be lightweight and fast, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. By keeping the framework simple and streamlined, developers are able to build applications quickly and efficiently, without getting bogged down in unnecessary complexity.

One of the key benefits of this minimalist approach is that it allows developers to focus on what really matters: building great applications. With `Lightning`, developers can spend less time worrying about the framework and more time creating high-quality, performant applications that meet their users' needs.

## With the power of AI

The `Lightning` framework is a powerful and versatile web framework for Go. It is designed to be lightweight and fast, making it an ideal choice for developers who seek high performance and ease of use. One of the key features that sets `Lightning` apart from other frameworks is its use of artificial intelligence (AI).

## Additional Features

The go `Lightning` framework has many features that make it a powerful tool for developing web applications, including:

- üé® Built-in JSON and HTML rendering
- ‚ö° Fast routing, with routing algorithm implemented based on Trie tree
- üî• Support for grouping routes and applying middleware to specific groups
- üìù Supports middleware, include global scope and route socpe middleware
- üöÄ Customizable 404 Not Found and 500 Internal Server Error handler functions
